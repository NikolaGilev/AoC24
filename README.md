this will be my 1st time participating in Advent of Code.

I will be solving the challenges using multiple programming languages in the following order:

1. python - Day 1, 6, 11, 16, 21
2. C# - Day 2, 7, 12, 17, 22
3. rust - Day 3, 8, 13, 18, 23
4. js or ts - Day 4, 9, 14, 19, 24
5. lua - Day 5, 10,15, 20, 25

On second thought I'm bored of C#, js & python so I'll just do this year in (mostly) rust and (a bit of) lua.
